    <p> We have met the expectations of this project in the following ways:
        <br>
        1. We chose to make a website for OmTech which is a student organization on campus. Laura is on the organization's executive board, but she is not the only member.
        <br>
        2. The pages on our website all use a cohesive header that includes omtech's logo and the organization's name.
        <br>
        3. Our site includes the ten following pages:
            
        <br>- About Us: a general introduction to the group
            <br>
            - Contact Us: gives users a way to reach out to the board
            <br>
            - Meet the Board: Overview of all the members on the executive board
            <br>
            - Meet the President: Lets users get to know more about omtech's president
            <br>
            - Meet the VP: Lets users get to know more about omtech's vp and Treasurer.
            <br>
            - Meet the secretary: Lets users get to know more about omtech's secretary
            <br>
            - Meet the webmaster: Lets users get to know more about omtech's webmaster
            <br>
            - Events: Gives an overview of each of the events being held in the current Semester
            <br>
            - News: Provides a single source where users can find updates on what omtech is doing throughout the year
            <br>
            - Homepage: General landing page that gives users a look into the organization
            <br>
            4. We include navigational links in our navbar as well as in the footer to an external link and on our meet the board page to thier individual biography pages.
        <br>
        5. We have media queries on all pages to ensure that the website looks good for any type of device.
        <br>
        6. We have a global style sheet that keeps the style of all of our main elements the same throughout the entire site and each page has their own style sheet for anything that is individualized to them.
        <br>
        7. All of our images have alt attributes that give a description of the content of the image.
        <br>
        8. Each page has the same favicon which is omtech's Logo.
        <br>
        9. All of our images are stored in a folder titled images and all of our css are stored in a folder called css.
        <br>
        10. We did not use any libraries or frameworks on this project.
        <br>
        11. All of our pages have been validated using the W3C validators.
        <br>
        13. All of our files have the correct naming syntax.
        <br>
        14. To the best of our knowledge, all of our content looks neatly aligned.
        <br>
        15. We use multiple font faces and multiple font families throughout our website including monospace, Trebuchet MS, and gill sans just to name a few.
        <br>
        16. We include a link to Omtech's facebook group in the footer of every page. This link opens a new tab and does not just replace the original page.
        <br>
        17. To our knowledge our source code seems to be readable, we were all able to work collaboratively on this project without getting confused on classes, names, or any other aspect.
        <br>
        18. Our site uses the same navbar on every page, and it has the same responsiveness on every page.
        <br>
        19. We include a consistent header and footer on every page.
        <br>
        20. We used flexboxes on every page of our website.
        <br>
        Critique from client:
        <br>
        The OmTech executive board loves the website. They are excited to see all of our groups information in one spot and not in multiple different spots across social media and the university's website. They are excited to see what comes next when we are able to implement APIs that allow us to automatically post information to the site and not have to manually enter anything in.
