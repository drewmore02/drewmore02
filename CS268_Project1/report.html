    <p>
      We have met the expectations of this project in the following ways:
      <br />
      1. We chose to make a website for OmTech which is a student organization
      on campus. Laura is on the organization's executive board, but she is not
      the only member.
      <br />
      2. The pages on our website all use a cohesive header that includes
      omtech's logo and the organization's name.
      <br />
      3. Our site includes the ten following pages:

      <br />- About Us: a general introduction to the group
      <br />
      - Contact Us: gives users a way to reach out to the board
      <br />
      - Meet the Board: Overview of all the members on the executive board
      <br />
      - Meet the President: Lets users get to know more about omtech's president
      <br />
      - Meet the VP: Lets users get to know more about omtech's vp and
      Treasurer.
      <br />
      - Meet the secretary: Lets users get to know more about omtech's secretary
      <br />
      - Meet the webmaster: Lets users get to know more about omtech's webmaster
      <br />
      - Events: Gives an overview of each of the events being held in the
      current Semester
      <br />
      - News: Provides a single source where users can find updates on what
      omtech is doing throughout the year
      <br />
      - Homepage: General landing page that gives users a look into the
      organization
      <br />
      4. We include navigational links in our navbar as well as in the footer to
      an external link and on our meet the board page to thier individual
      biography pages.
      <br />
      5. We have media queries on all pages to ensure that the website looks
      good for any type of device.
      <br />
      6. We have a global style sheet that keeps the style of all of our main
      elements the same throughout the entire site and each page has their own
      style sheet for anything that is individualized to them.
      <br />
      7. All of our images have alt attributes that give a description of the
      content of the image.
      <br />
      8. Each page has the same favicon which is omtech's Logo.
      <br />
      9. All of our images are stored in a folder titled images and all of our
      css are stored in a folder called css.
      <br />
      10. We did not use any libraries or frameworks on this project.
      <br />
      11. All names of files are entirely lowercase
      <br />
      12. Our content is neatly aligned and the axes are claerly visible.
      <br />
      13. We use multiple font faces and multiple font families throughout our
      website including monospace, Trebuchet MS, and gill sans just to name a
      few.
      <br />
      14. Our site does implement 4 different pages with forms. We have our
      events, news, contact, and admin pages
      <br />
      15. We include a link to Omtech's facebook group in the footer of every
      page. This link opens a new tab and does not just replace the original
      page.
      <br />
      16. To our knowledge our source code seems to be readable, we were all
      able to work collaboratively on this project without getting confused on
      classes, names, or any other aspect.
      <br />
      17. Our site does include an animation on the about page.
      <br />
      18. Yes, our site relies on MySQL as our database for storing and
      retrieving data.
      <br />
      19. We have an admin login button in the navbar with admin login
      credentials. It takes you to an administrator panel where you can add
      events and add news.
      <br />
      20. We fixed the coloring on the board members page as well as fixing the
      nav bar so that it doesn't follow the page downward.
      <br />

    <h4>Critique From Client:</h4>
    <p>OmTech loves the updates to the website! The love the functionality added with PHP which will make it easy for future 
        Webmasters to be able to edit the page without having to change the actual code of the site. Looking forward OmTech
        is going to hosting the website so it can be used after this project. </p>
    <h4>Comments from Project 1</h4>
    <p>
      Colors on the meet the board page were changed to make the site more cohesive. We also updated the nav bar so that it 
      is no longer moving over the rest of the elements of the page and is now stuck to the top. We also added minor padding
      edits to fix the visual aspects of some pages. Finally, we focused on ensuring that everything on our page can be edited
      through POST requests so that the website can be used by future members who may not be experienced in CS. 
    </p>
    <h4>Which webpages have forms in them</h4>
    <p>The webpages with form include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact Us</li>
      <li>Admin Login</li>
      <li>Add Event</li>
      <li>Add News</li>
      <li>Edit President/Vice President/Secretary/Webmaster/Treasurer</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Laura's Contributions</h4>
    <p>
        Took Drew's layout of the homepage and made it functional. Created the meet the board and each indivdual board 
        member pages. I also created the original static news, about us, and contact us pages. I also organized all of our 
        files to make sure they fit the proper critera for submission. Added the PHP functionality for the meet the board 
        and individual board member pages and the contact us page along with creating a functional slideshow for the about 
        us page. I also added the login functionality and made sure that it was secure and only authorized users could 
        access admin only pages. I created most of the SQL queries to populate the beginning of our database. These were 
        tweaked over time by the other two members. Finally, I made corrections to the feedback given for the first half 
        of this project.  
    </p>
    <h4>Mike's Contributions</h4>
    <p>
      Added functionality to the admin pages for creating, reading, updating, and deleting
      from the events and news tables in our database. There are functions for each of these in databaseconn.php,
      and most of them just take $_POST as an argument. I created the editnews and editevents pages, and used jQuery 
      to add onClick events so the row information would be added to the "update" section. 
      I also created templates for the top and bottom parts of our pages so we could edit our nav bar or footer from one 
      place instead of on every page. An array of css files accompanies the inclusion of the top template for the 
      different styles on each page.
    </p>
    <h4>Drew's Contributions</h4>
    <p>
      Designed the original layout of the home page on canva and worked on
      making the navbar modern-estque by having media queries in the css to make
      it work fore resized browser or mobile devices. Worked on Contact Us page
      styling to have the form sized properly. Wrote the get requests for the
      news and events pages.
