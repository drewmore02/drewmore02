                <p class="aboutFont">The Organization for Minorities in Technology (OMTECH), previously known as WITS,
                    has been established to support and promote minorities in information technologies and encourage
                    women and other minorities to study computer science and/or other information systems. OMTECH is
                    dedicated to helping minorities gain self-confidence and "Computer confidence" by becoming involved
                    in activities and projects that enable them to skillfully and comfortably use information
                    technologies. This includes activities such as mentoring or role modeling, monitoring the status of
                    women and other minorities in industrial and academic computing through guest speakers and company
                    tours, and promoting communication among minorities in information technologies. While OMTECH is
                    centered around supporting and promoting minorities, all are welcome to join! </p>
                <h2 class="aboutHeader">A Word From Our President:</h2>
                <p class="aboutFont">Hello Everyone,

                    If you are looking for a fun organization that focuses on creating a fun and inviting environment
                    where you can meet new friend this is the place for you! While we are primary computer science
                    students and we do host technology related events such as speakers, coding game nights, or homework
                    help nights we are open to ANYONE who is willing to come. This is because a lot of our meetings also
                    try to engage everyone in the organization by creating fun memories via epic scavenger hunts all
                    over campus, competitive trivia nights, or escape rooms.

                    Whether its for 1 event or all of them we really hope to see you at OmTech! </p>
